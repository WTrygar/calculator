<h2>Simple calculator project from frontendmasters. Made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</h2>

latest update: added working power button and square root placeholder.

Calculator works as it should. Actions that You can do:
math operations: add (+), subtract (-), multiply (×), divide (÷), and other: clear (C), undo last typed digit (←).

Calculator can do operations on floats, but for now can't normally type float numbers. example:
9 / 2 == 4.5
4.5 + 5 == 5
can't type somthing like 4.5, but You can create it :)

TO DO:
1. add option to create floats,
2. add square root.
